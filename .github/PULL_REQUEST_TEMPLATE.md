# Information
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

   b. **After** that step, you're ready to open a pull request.

   c. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `main` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `develop` instead.

   d. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   e. Provide a description of your changes.

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.

**PLEASE REMOVE THAT `INFORMATION` PART BEFORE SUBMITTING**

## TP
- :heavy_check_mark: Create a application in order to vote students projects.
- :heavy_check_mark: Create a development environment for the project.

## Frontend quick definition:

- Admin can choose to add or remove questions for every project.
- Admin can enter project name somewhere.
- Admin cannot change vote option (1 to 10, with 0,5 increase). 
**Example** 
    - 0
    - 0.5
    - 1
    - 1.5 etc ...
- Not necessary backoffice for admin, it can be a configuration file only for questions, project names.
- Export results with a command (makefile)

**Example for a voting user:**
>
>- Vue 1: Enter your name (no connexion).

>- Vue 2: 
>Project name: Dentiio  
>
> Question 1: Interested into following ?
> Vote 1 to 10.
> Button > Next Question
> 
> Question 2: Interested into sponsoring ?
> Vote 1 to 10.  
> Submit button.  

> - Vue 2: 
> Project name: Hubbies Puppies
>
> Question 1: Interested into following ?
> Vote 1 to 10.
> Button > Next Question
> 
> Question 2: Interested into sponsoring ?
